To earn points, the players need to challenge the players to earn points in case of a victory. If the challenger wins the match, he will optain 3 points. If the challenged player is the winner, he will gain one single point.

You can have as many challenges as the following table shows:

- 3rd to 9th place: 2 weekly challanges
- 10th place: 3 weekly challanges

- 12th onwards: 5 weekly challanges

Also, the times you can be challenged is limitless.
